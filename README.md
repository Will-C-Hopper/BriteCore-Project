# BriteCore-Project
Engineering Project

# All of the informatin written about this project is my plan for this project at the current time, before any coding has been accomplished. Changes will be made as I move forward.

  To use this, you will log onto <website> with both username and password as ADMIN.
  
  From there, The form is fairly self-explanatory, you can select the user from the dropdown menu located at the top of the page
  
  To the right of this there will be another dropdown menu to select product area.
  
  Again, to the right of this, there will be an entry for priority. A priority of n will replace the last n priority and move all n equal to and reater than n to the next n.
  
  Directly beneath this, there will be a scrollable textbox that lists the prior submissions by the selected user.
      This is editable be simply selecting the submission, and making the necessary changes. This form will differ by having a button to mark the submission as complete, which will move the submission to an alternate location on the database server, accessible by clicking a link labeled <view completed submissions>.
  
  Directly underneath the user info form, there is a form for adding a title to the request.
  
  Below the title form there will be a textbox for adding a full description of the request.
  
  below this, there will be two date entry fields, one will be the date submitted (defaults to the current day), the other will be the date the client has made the request to be completed by.
  
  A submit button will be to the right of both of these, which ammends the request to the database to the priority given by the user.
